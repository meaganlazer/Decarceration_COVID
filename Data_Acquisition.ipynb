    "This project scrapes daily jail roster information to create a large dataset. This dataset is designed to analyze how jail populations have fluctuated in response to COVID-19. Research centers on explaining why county jails in different parts of the United States have responded differently to the pandemic over time. \n",

    "A separate but related idea for this dataset analyzes the impact of pandemic-related jail population declines on local crime. This project uses daily jail roster population counts as the focal variable and the analysis uses group-based trajectory modeling. Our scraped data will address gaps in the [Vera](https://github.com/vera-institute/jail-population-data) dataset.\n",
